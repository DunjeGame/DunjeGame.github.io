		<div> New This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</div>
		<p>Leaderboard</p>
		<div> Most of our apps use Game Center in order to show you a Leaderboard. Therefore, we do not collect nor process any of your personal data in order to show you a Leaderboard on those games; our partners do it, instead, so please refer to Terms&Conditions/Privacy Notes from them in order to know more about how they treat your data and your rights on that regards. Your consent to collect and process, in that case, would have been gathered by those providers when you subscribed to their services.</div>
